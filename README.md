# Tech Quiz - Test Suite

## Description

Learning how to test your applications is vital to becoming a Software Engineer. This is a sure fire way to know if your application is functioning as you expect, at all times. It's as if an autobot is testing your code via Cypress, while also allowing you as a user to manually test various app features. SDET's are NOT the only ones responsible for testing a code base, and the sooner that is instilled within you as an SE, the better. This app will help quiz an individual on the various aspects of testing, from a UI perspective. It's overall goal, however, is to help a user understand how to code out cypress functionality within an application - from start to finish. If successful, the cypress UI (via electron) will show if your tests have passed or not.

It should be noted - I was provided starter code that covered the client and server side functionality. It was my job to add cypress test functionality. Therefore, I am making known that the starter code was not my own, but that of UNC's Bootcamp instructors.

## Video Walkthrough

This video walkthrough will depict overall functionality of the API endpoints and json objects being returned with use data. You will also see this data creation via Mongoose. Visit this link for the video: https://drive.google.com/file/d/17r7CFI_NYA-R_Tx194B4pkY7J2ayVXAL/view

## Installation

Users can clone this code repo using an IDE of choice. They must ensure npm, express, and mongodb are all installed. As always, be mindful of dependencies and package scripts listed in the package.json file. Upon doing so, the user will need to open Postman or Insomnia to test out their endpoint functionality.
